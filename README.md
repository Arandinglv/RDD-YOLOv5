# RDD-YOLOv5

This program is an improved-YOLOv5 version, used for road defect detection. The original version is [https://github.com/ultralytics.](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

The paper is *RDD-YOLOv5: Road Defect Detection Algorithm with Self-Attention Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Inspection*. Discussions and suggestions are welcome. 

The architecture can seen in the figure:

Relative network configuiration is in the https://github.com/arandinglv/RDD-YOLOv5/blob/main/models/yolov5m_2evc_swin_gelu.yaml

The Road Defect Dataset is uploaded on BaiduNetDisk:
